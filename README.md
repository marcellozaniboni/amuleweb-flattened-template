# amuleweb-flattened-template
aMuleWeb template, derived from the original default template, with a more flattened and modern look

This template contains code and images from the official default template of aMule version 2.3.3. I didn't like the old-style look of the original web interface and just made some fixes. I flattened images, added tooltips, reorganized the search form and made the tables borders lighter.
